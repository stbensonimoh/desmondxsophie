## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Database**: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- **ORM**: [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Local Development**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stbensonimoh/desmondxsophie.git
cd desmondxsophie
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example `.env` file and update the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the following in your `.env` file:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Should match your local MySQL setup.
- `INVITE_TOKEN_SECRET`: A long, random string for signing tokens.
- `INVITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: A strong password for the admin dashboard.
- `SMS_API_URL` & `SMS_API_KEY`: Your SMS provider's credentials (optional).

### 4. Start the Database

Run the local MySQL database using Docker Compose:

```bash
bun run db:up
```

### 5. Apply Database Migrations

Apply the Prisma schema to your local database:

```bash
bunx prisma migrate dev
```

### 6. Seed the Database

Seed the database with some sample guests and invite codes:

```bash
bun run seed
```

This will print sample invite links to your terminal.

### 7. Run the Development Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üîê Admin Access

- **URL**: [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)
- **Password**: The value of `INVITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file.

## üìú Available Scripts

- `bun run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `bun run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `bun run start`: Starts a production server.
- `bun run db:up`: Starts the local MySQL container.
- `bun run db:down`: Stops the local MySQL container.
- `bun run db:logs`: Tails the database logs.
- `bun run prisma:migrate`: Applies database migrations.
- `bun run seed`: Seeds the database with sample data.
